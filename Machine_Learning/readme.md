# Complete Roadmap to Master ML


![2020 machine learning roadmap overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/machine-learning-roadmap/master/2020-ml-roadmap-overview.png?token=AD7ZOCOIG7IZXHDL63W6RZK7A3B6I)

See the [full interactive version](https://whimsical.com/machine-learning-roadmap-2020-CA7f3ykvXpnJ9Az32vYXva).

## Prerequisites:

In order for you to understand the concept of Machine Learning and everything about it  you need to know the fundamentals in and out. This includes the theories, concepts, methods, and algorithms behind it - why they do what they do and how they all act as a building block to Machine Learning. These prerequisites are surrounding analytical work, which helps you further down the line as a Machine Learning Engineer: 

- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics 
- Matrices 
- Calculus 

Here are some resources that can help you:

## Steps that you should take to master Machine Learning:

### Step1: Pick a programming language & Get Started!

The first step to start learning machine learning is to pick up a programming language. There are different programming languages in the market, but the most suitable for machine learning are Python and R.

I recommend Python. Why? Because its popular, easy to learn and future-ready.
With Python, you can switch domains easily. Python offers popular frameworks like Django and Flask for backend development, Tkinter for GUI development, Pygames for Game development, etc.

If you go with Python, you must learn sklearn for Machine Learning. [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a modern machine learning library written in Python. 
The best thing about sklearn is that most of the Machine learning algorithms are written for you already. It has a lot of useful classes for preprocessing your data for further analysis


### Step2: Rework on Fundamentals.

You should learn/revise Linear Algebra,Calculus,Probability and Statistics if you wish to master Machine Learning and become a pro!
This is essential because if you want to tune your models with maximum flexibility, you need to know how they work, and knowing fundamentals/prerequisites is a must for that!


### Step3: Learn Core ML Algorithms.

Once you have a good understanding of the foundational math and sklearn after learning python, you will then be able to whizz through understanding the machine learning algorithms - as it’s all based on Maths.


There are 4 different types of machine learning algorithms:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Semi-Supervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

The type of machine learning algorithms that you will frequently work with and are very popular are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM’s)
- Naive Bayes
- KNN classification
- K-Means
- Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)

### Step4: Learn Python Libraries.

As a Machine Learning engineer, you will spend a lot of your time building algorithms and applications. Therefore, you need to understand the libraries that help build these. Machine Learning libraries are a collection of functions that have been created to help develop machine learning applications - through their prepackaged functions. 

Here is a list of the most well-known and used libraries: 

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide)- Managing tabular data.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/learn/)- Scientific computation.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index)- Data visualization.
- [Scikit-Learn ](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)- Data preprocessing and modeling.
- [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/index.html#user-guide)- Scientific computation.
- [NLTK ](https://www.nltk.org/)- Text processing.
- [TensorFlow ](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn)- Deep Learning.
- [Keras ](https://keras.io/guides/)- Deep Learning.
- [PyTorch ](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)- Deep Learning.
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)- Tools to build, train and deploy ML models.

The best way to learn about these libraries is through their User Guides and Documentation, which have all been linked above. 


### Step5: Projects!

So you’ve mastered the fundamentals, machine learning algorithms, and libraries - the next step is to take all that knowledge and skill and apply it to real-world cases. This not only tests your skills and presents you with your strengths and weaknesses in the field. But it also helps you add to your portfolio - which will help you in the next stage!
